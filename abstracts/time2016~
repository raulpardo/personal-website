Online Social Networks are ubiquitous, bringing not only numerous new
possibilities but also big threats and challenges. Privacy is one of
them.  Most social networks today offer a limited set of (static)
privacy settings, not being able to express dynamic policies.  For
instance, users might decide to protect their location during the
night, or share information with difference audiences depending on
their current position.  In this paper we introduce TFPPF, a formal
framework to express, and reason about, dynamic (and recurrent)
privacy policies that are activated or deactivated by context (events)
or time.  Besides a formal policy language (TPPL), the framework
includes a knowledge-based logic extended with (linear) temporal
operators and a learning modality (TKBL). Policies, and formulae in
the logic, are interpreted over (timed) traces representing the
evolution of the social network.  We prove that checking privacy
policy conformance, and the model-checking problem for TKBL, are both
decidable.
