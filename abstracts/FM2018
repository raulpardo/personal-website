We present an epistemic logic equipped with time-stamps in atoms and epistemic
operators, which enables reasoning about the moments at which events happen and
knowledge is acquired or deduced. Our logic includes both an epistemic operator
K and a belief operator B, to capture the disclosure of inaccurate information.
Our main motivation is to describe rich privacy policies in online social
networks (OSNs). Most of today's privacy policy mechanisms in existing OSNs
allow only static policies. In our logic, it is possible to express rich dynamic
policies in terms of the knowledge available to the different users and the
precise time of actions and deductions. Our framework can be instantiated for
different OSNs, by specifying the effect of the actions in the evolution of the
social network and in the knowledge disclosed to each user. We present an
algorithm for deducing knowledge and propagating beliefs, which can also be
instantiated with different variants of how the epistemic information is
preserved through time. Policies are modelled as formulae in the logic, which
are interpreted over timed traces. Finally, we show that model-checking is
decidable.
