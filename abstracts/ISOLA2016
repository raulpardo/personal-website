Online Social Networks have increased the need to understand well and
extend the expressiveness of privacy policies. In particular, the need
to be able to define and enforce dynamic (and recurrent) policies that
are activated or deactivated by context (events) or timeouts. We
propose an automaton-based approach to define and enforce such
policies using runtime verification techniques. In this paper we
discuss how our proposed solution addresses this problem without
focussing on concrete technical details.
