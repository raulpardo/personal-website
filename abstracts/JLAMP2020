Most Online Social Networks allow users to set their privacy settings
concerning posting information, but current implementations do not
allow a fine grained enforcement in case the posted item concerns
other users. In this paper we propose a new collaborative access
control framework that takes into account the relation of multiple
users for viewing as well as for sharing items, eventually solving
conflicts in the privacy settings of the users involved. Our solution
relies on two algorithms, one for viewing and another one for sharing
items. We provide an evaluation of these algorithms where we
demonstrate how varying some of the parameters directly influences the
decision of viewing or sharing an item. Last but not least, we present
a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach in an open source
social network called Diaspora.
