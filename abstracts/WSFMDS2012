In this work we present the first version of ROSA Analyser, a tool in
order to get closer to a fully automatic process of analysing the
behaviour of a system specified as a process of the Markovian Process
Algebra ROSA. In this first development stage, ROSA Analyser is able
to generate the Labelled Transition System, according to ROSA
Operational Semantics.  ROSA Analyser performance starts with the
Syntactic Analysis so generating a layered structure, suitable to
then, apply the Operational Semantics Transition rules in the easier
way. ROSA Analyser is able to recognize some states identities deeper
than the Syntactic ones. This is the very first step in the way to
reduce the size of the LTS and then to avoid the explosion of states
problem, so making this task more tractable.  For the sake of better
illustrating the usefulness of ROSA Analyser, a case study is also
provided within this work.
