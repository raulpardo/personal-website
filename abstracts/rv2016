Online Social Networks (OSNs) are ubiquitous, with more than 70% of
Internet users being active users of such networking services. This widespread
use of OSNs brings with it big threats and challenges, privacy being one of
them.  Most OSNs today offer a limited set of (static) privacy settings and do
not allow for the definition, even less enforcement, of more dynamic privacy
policies. In this paper we are concerned with the specification and enforcement
of dynamic (and recurrent) privacy policies that are activated or deactivated by
context (events). In particular, we present a novel formalism of policy
automata, transition systems where privacy policies may be defined per state. We
further propose an approach based on runtime verification techniques to define
and enforce such policies. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation for the
distributed social network Diaspora, using the runtime verification tool LARVA
to synthesise enforcement monitors.
