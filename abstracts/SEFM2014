Social networks (SN) provide a great opportunity to help people
interact with each other in different ways depending on the kind of
relationship that links them. One of the aims of SN is to be flexible
in the way one shares information, being as permissive as possible in
how people communicate and disseminate information. While preserving
the spirit of SN, users would like to be sure that their privacy is
not compromised. One way to do so is by providing users with means to
define their own privacy policies and give guarantees that they will
be respected. In this paper we present a privacy policy framework for
SN, consisting of a formal model of SN, a knowledge-based logic, and a
formal privacy policy language. The framework may be tailored by
providing suitable instantiations of the different relationships, the
events, the propositions representing what is to be known, and the
additional facts or rules a particular social network should satisfy.
Besides, models of Facebook and Twitter are instantiated in our
formalism, and we provide instantiations of a number of richer privacy
policies.
