In this paper, we present an approach to enhance informed consent for
the processing of personal data. The approach relies on a privacy
policy language used to express, compare and analyze privacy
policies. We describe a tool that automatically reports the privacy
risks associated with a given privacy policy in order to enhance data
subjects' awareness and to allow them to make more informed
choices. The risk analysis of privacy policies is illustrated with an
IoT example.
